 In my conversation with TISH poet Robert Hogg (See the 27:23 min mark of the SpokenWeb podcast https://spokenweb.ca/podcast/episodes/robert-hogg-the-widening-circle-of-return/) we discuss how understanding  the poem “I Know a Man” hinges on hearing Creeley perform the poem. Charles Olson, often referred to as the father of postmodern poetics, quotes Creeley in his seminal Projective Verse essay as stating: “FORM IS NEVER MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CONTENT.”  

As a way to generate qualitative data to better understand how poems performed are interpolated in relation to the same poems read on a page, this prototype employs AudiAnnotate to enable comparative analysis of five different performances of Creeley's poem “I Know a Man." The form of “I Know a Man” employs techniques such as enjambment to generate meaning. How one recites the poem and observes or ignores its line breaks becomes crucial to grasping its content. Please engage with the performances by jumping back and forth, listening to how different readers perform the same lines. Listen straight through and then go back and listen in and out of order by clicking the “annotation” tab at the top. Have fun and if you hear differences please note them and share them during the workshop.
