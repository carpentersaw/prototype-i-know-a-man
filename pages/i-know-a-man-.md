<em>By Robert Creeley</em>

As I sd to my<br>
friend, because I am<br>
always talking, -John, I<br>

sd, which was not his<br>
name, the darkness sur-<br>
rounds us, what<br>

can we do against
it, or else, shall we &<br>
why not, buy a goddamn big car,<br>

drive, he sd, for<br>
christ's sake, look<br>
out where yr going.<br>


As a way to generate qualitative data to better understand how poems performed are interpolated in relation to the same poems read on a page, this prototype employs AudiAnnotate to enable comparative analysis of five different performances of Creeley's poem “I Know a Man." How might AudiAnnotate aid in the study of recorded/sounded poetry? Does AA afford new ways to study these five unique performances? Developed to generate a means to annotate audio files, I have approached the tool a little differently by editing several recitations of one poem into a single audio file. I import the single audio file into the program Audacity where I then generate time stamped labels of its lines that can be imported into a manifest in the AudiAnnotate platform. Users interfacing with the project can now use the annotated manifest to listen more precisely to separate lines of the poem across different readings.

In my conversation with TISH poet Robert Hogg (See the 27:23 min mark of the SpokenWeb podcast https://spokenweb.ca/podcast/episodes/robert-hogg-the-widening-circle-of-return/) we discuss how understanding the poem “I Know a Man” hinges on hearing Creeley perform the poem.  The form of “I Know a Man” employs techniques such as enjambment to generate meaning. Because how and when he breaks his lines generates meaning, I was curious to hear if Creeley's performance of his own poem changed across performances. Charles Olson, often referred to as the father of postmodern poetics, quotes Creeley in his seminal Projective Verse essay as stating: “FORM IS NEVER MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CONTENT.” AA can enable a comparison of not only the timing of Creeley's different performances of the poem but also all the other paralinual qualities such as timbre, tone, pitch and velocity. Engage with the performances by jumping back and forth, listening to different versions of Creeley's performance. Listen straight through and then go back and listen in and out of order by clicking the “annotation” tab at the top.
