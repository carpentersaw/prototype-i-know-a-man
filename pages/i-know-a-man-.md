  As I sd to my<br> 
  friend, because I am<br>
  always talking, -John, I<br>
  
  sd, which was not his<br>
  name, the darkness sur-<br>

  can we do against<br>
  it, or else, shall we &<br>
  why not, buy a goddamn big car,<br>
    
  drive, he sd, for<br>
  christ's sake, look<br>
  out where yr going.<br> 

This prototype is concerned with evolving a literary scholarship attentive to or rooted in the performed versions of poems. One challenge with studying performed poems has been the inability to attentively listen to lines in and out of order, or to return to and go back to a line. When a poem is read on the page we can read it in and out of order to decipher its meaning. Sound cannot be paused and is ephemeral in nature. This fleeting nature of sound challenges scholarly analysis. This prototype explores the use of the tool AudiAnnotate to aid in the study of recorded/sounded poetry. As Charles Bernstein writes in introduction to "Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word", poetry readings and performed poems have not been given equal critical attention compared to printed and published poems. What if performed poetry is studied as a primary source? What can we learn that we cannot from its written counterpart? In order to begin explore new ways of studying performed poetry I am employing the tool AudiAnnotate. Initially developed to generate a means to annotate audio files, I have approached the tool a little differently by editing several recitations of one poem into a single audio file. I import the single audio file into the program Audacity where I then generate time stamped labels of its lines that can be imported into a manifest in the AudiAnnotate platform. Users interfacing with the project can now use the annotated manifest to listen more precisely to separate lines of the poem across different readings.

In my conversation with TISH poet Robert Hogg (See the 27:23 min mark of the SpokenWeb podcast https://spokenweb.ca/podcast/episodes/robert-hogg-the-widening-circle-of-return/) we discuss how understanding the poem “I Know a Man” hinges on hearing Creeley perform the poem. As a way to generate qualitative data to better understand how poems performed are interpolated in relation to the same poems read on a page, this prototype employs AudiAnnotate to enable comparative analysis of five different performances of Creeley's poem “I Know a Man." The form of “I Know a Man” employs techniques such as enjambment to generate meaning. Because how and when he breaks his lines generates meaning, I was curious to hear if Creeley's performance of his own poem changed across performances. Charles Olson, often referred to as the father of postmodern poetics, quotes Creeley in his seminal Projective Verse essay as stating: “FORM IS NEVER MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CONTENT.”  AA has enabled me to closely compare not only the timing of Creeley's different performances of the poem but also all the other paralinual qualities such as timbre, tone, pitch and velocity. Please engage with the performances by jumping back and forth, listening to different versions of Creeley's performance. Listen straight through and then go back and listen in and out of order by clicking the “annotate” tab at the top. Have fun and if you hear differences please note them and share them during the workshop.
